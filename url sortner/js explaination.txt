1.The code defines an asynchronous arrow function called shortenUrl. This function is responsible for shortening the URL and handling the response.

2.The long URL is retrieved from the input field with the id 'long-url' using document.getElementById('long-url').value.

3.A request is made to the https://api.shrtco.de/v2/shorten endpoint using the fetch function. The long URL is passed as a query parameter in the URL using template literals.

4.The response from the API is awaited using the await keyword, and the response data is extracted by calling response.json().

5.The data object contains the shortened URL in the result.full_short_link property.

6.The code then fetches the necessary DOM elements: shortUrlContainer, shortUrlLink, and copyBtn, using their respective id values.

7.The href attribute of the shortUrlLink element is set to the shortUrl value obtained from the API response. This makes the shortened URL clickable.

8.The textContent property of shortUrlLink is also set to the shortUrl, displaying the shortened URL as the link text.

9The shortUrlContainer is displayed on the webpage by setting its style.display property to 'block'.

10.An event listener is added to the copyBtn element to handle the click event. When the button is clicked, the shortened URL is copied to the clipboard using navigator.clipboard.writeText(shortUrl).

11.After the URL is successfully copied, an alert message is displayed to notify the user.
